# Feature Reference

This page is the compact reference for users and maintainers. It describes what
the integration exposes, where to configure it, and which parts write to the
C300X only after an explicit user action.

## Operating Model

The integration is local-first:

- Home Assistant talks to the native C300X agent through the local `/api/v1`
  HTTP API.
- The native agent pushes events back to Home Assistant webhooks.
- Camera, Ring Call, Home Call and talkback use Home Assistant's WebRTC
  provider/go2rtc path.
- Core device state is event-driven; Home Assistant should not need polling for
  normal doorbell, call, ringer, forwarding, memo or message changes.
- Optional maintenance actions can write device-side config, but they are
  explicit setup, options or Repair actions.

## Setup and Options

| Area | Purpose | Writes to device |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection | Agent host, port, API token, maintenance token, optional callback base URL. | No, except token setup during explicit bootstrap/install. |
| Media features | Doorstation media, Home Assistant media user, live audio gain, Ring Capture gain. | Media-user setup writes only when setup/Repair is run. Audio gain is runtime-only and is sent only when non-default or different. |
| Device activations | Optional extra C300X activation buttons. | Only after saving, and only when the desired activation config differs. |
| Display dashboard | Optional Display patch, Alarmo/weather/dashboard entities and action allowlist. | Yes, only when the Display patch is applied/restored. |
| Maintenance controls | SSH, noAuth, mDNS discovery, firewall patches, GUI reload, reboot, agent update/remove. | Yes, only when the corresponding entity, button or Repair is used. |

## Main User Features

| Feature | User surface | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Doorbell ring event | Event entity, automations, blueprints, card state. | Receives real C300X ring events from the native agent. |
| On-demand camera | Camera entity, C300X Doorbell Call Card, `activate_doorbell_video` / `stop_doorbell_video`. | Uses local RTSP through Home Assistant's WebRTC provider/go2rtc. |
| Ring Call preview | C300X Doorbell Call Card. | Multiple browser previews are supported; only the active answered browser should show Answer/Hang Up. |
| Ring Call answer/hangup | C300X card, mobile blueprints, `answer_doorbell_call`, `hangup_doorbell_call`. | Requires Forwarding set to Home Assistant and media readiness without blocking failures. |
| Talkback | Browser microphone through the card. | Requires HTTPS, Home Assistant Cloud, or another secure browser context with microphone permission. |
| Home Call | C300X card, Home Call websocket path, `start_home_call`, `stop_home_call`. | Audio-only call from Home Assistant to the C300X display. |
| Door unlock | Button entity, service, optional dashboard action. | Sends one configured unlock command through the native agent. |
| Stair light | Button entity, service, optional generated activation. | Manual mode uses P/N parts to generate the stair-light activation address. |
| Device activations | Button entities, `run_device_activation`. | Supports `lock`, `light`, `stair_light`, `scenario`, and `generic` activation types. |
| Forwarding | Select entity. | Values are Smartphone, Home Assistant and Blocked. Ring Call answer needs Home Assistant. |
| Ringer mute and volume | Switch and number entity. | Volume uses the C300X display scale `0..10`; `0` is muted. |
| Answering machine | Switch and video-message sensor/services. | Message delete requires the Display patch. |
| Text and voice memos | Sensors and memo services. | Text memo write and latest memo playback are service driven. Delete requires the Display patch. |
| Display pages | Optional C300X display dashboard. | Native QML pages, not Lovelace embedding; no Home Assistant token is stored on the device display side. |
| Ring Capture and local analysis | Services and blueprints. | Writes local MP4/WAV/JPEG/JSON below allowed Home Assistant paths; local Wyoming transcription is optional. |
| Media readiness and Repairs | Diagnostic sensor and Repair flows. | First place to look when camera, Ring Call, Home Call or talkback fails. |

## Device Activations

Device activations are configured from setup, options, or reconfigure. They are
not raw JSON input for normal users.

Modes:

- **Automatic** keeps the generated stair-light activation out of the payload and
  uses activation items as configured by the user or reported by the agent.
- **Manual** reserves the `stair_light` id and generates one stair-light item
  from P/N address parts. This leaves up to 15 additional user-managed items.

Limits:

- Maximum total activation items sent to the native agent: `16`.
- Activation IDs: letters, numbers, `_` and `-`, up to 32 characters.
- Activation address: OpenWebNet `where` value, up to 31 characters.
- Activation names: up to 63 characters.

## Media and Audio

Live browser media uses Home Assistant's WebRTC provider/go2rtc. The native
agent exposes RTSP sources for:

- ring preview video,
- answered Ring Call audio/video with talkback backchannel,
- on-demand doorstation audio/video,
- Home Call audio.

Audio gain options:

- **Doorstation live audio gain** affects on-demand and Ring Call downstream
  audio. Default is `0 dB`.
- **Ring capture audio gain** affects Ring Capture WAV/MP4 processing. Default
  is `6 dB`.
- The allowed range is `-20 dB` to `+20 dB`.
- At `0 dB`, live audio stays on the neutral path and the integration avoids
  unnecessary gain updates.
